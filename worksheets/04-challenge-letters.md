# Challenge - Letters

Time for a second challenge! You don't have to use Turtle to draw shapes, you can use it to draw anything you like.

## The challenge

Create a new script called `Letters.py` that uses Turtle to draw your name.

## Extension

Can you get Turtle to draw any word that the user inputs?
