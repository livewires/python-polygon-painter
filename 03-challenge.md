The time has come to put your learning into action!

Create a new script called `Challenge.py` that uses Turtle to draw polygons.

1. The user could input how many polygons they want to draw
2. Each polygon could:
    - Be drawn...
        - ... in a different location
        - ... at a different angle
    - Have a different...
        - ... pen colour
        - ... pen size
        - ... speed
        - ... size
        - ... number of sides
