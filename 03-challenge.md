# Challenge

The time has come to put your learning into action!

Create a new script called `Challenge.py` that uses Turtle to draw regular polygons.

## What is a polygon?

### Polygon

A polygon is a closed 2D shape whose sides are all straight. For example, a right angled triangle or a rectangle but not a semi-circle.

### Regular polygon

A regular polygon is a polygon whose sides are all the same length and angles are all the same size. For example, a square or an equilateral triangle.

### Angles

#### Interior angles

An interior angle of a polygon is the angle between two sides in one corner (or vertex) on the **inside** of the polygon.

#### Exterior angles

An exterior angle of a polygon is the angle made between one side of a polygon and a line extended from another side of the polygon.

#### Facts about interior and exterior angles

- The total of all the interior angles in an $n$ sided polygon equals $(n - 2) * 180$.
- The sum of an interior and an exterior angle of a polygon equals 180.
- The total of all the exterior angles in a polygon equals 360.
- One exterior angle of a regular $n$ sided polygon equals $360 รท n$.


## The challenge

1. The user could input how many regular polygons they want to draw
2. Each regular polygon could:
    - Be drawn...
        - ... in a different location
        - ... at a different angle
    - Have a different...
        - ... pen colour
        - ... pen size
        - ... fill colour
        - ... speed
        - ... size
        - ... number of sides

For example:
